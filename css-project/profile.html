        Hi i am Virat Kohli . I was born on 5 November 1988 and i am  currently 33 years old.I am an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national cricket team.<br>
        In August 2008 , I was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.
        My first foray into leadership on an international level was when I was made vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May â€“ June 2010, this came about as many more established players were rested for the tour. I made 168 runs at an average of 42.00 including two fifties. During the series, I became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket. I made my International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, I batted at 3 in an Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.
